    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      Generative AI tools like ChatGPT, Google Gemini, and Claude are revolutionizing the way professionals plan, grow, and advance their careers. These tools bring powerful natural language capabilities that make them valuable assistants for resume writing, job hunting, skill building, and personal branding.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-teal-600 mt-8 mb-4">1. Resume Optimization</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      Generative AI can analyze job descriptions and tailor resumes to match the language, skills, and requirements employers are seeking. It can suggest action verbs, rewrite bullet points for clarity, and format content for ATS (Applicant Tracking System) compatibility.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-teal-600 mt-8 mb-4">2. Personalized Resume Generation</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      By inputting your background, experience, and goals, AI can generate a complete resume draft in seconds. These drafts often include well-structured summaries, experience sections, and quantifiable achievements based on the latest hiring trends.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-teal-600 mt-8 mb-4">3. Cover Letter Drafting</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      Generative AI can also create personalized cover letters tailored to each job role. It ensures tone consistency, highlights relevant experience, and demonstrates genuine interest in the company — saving hours of manual writing.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-teal-600 mt-8 mb-4">4. Job Description Analysis</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      AI can break down complex job descriptions into essential requirements, preferred qualifications, and technical skills. This helps job seekers better understand what the role demands and tailor their applications accordingly.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-teal-600 mt-8 mb-4">5. Keyword Insertion</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      AI identifies critical keywords missing from a resume and integrates them naturally. This increases the likelihood of passing ATS filters used by recruiters in many organizations.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-teal-600 mt-8 mb-4">6. Proofreading and Grammar Checks</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      AI-powered tools excel at detecting typos, awkward phrasing, and grammar mistakes. They also help maintain a professional tone and consistency across documents.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-teal-600 mt-8 mb-4">7. LinkedIn Profile Enhancement</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      AI can rewrite your LinkedIn summary, headline, and experience descriptions to better reflect your strengths and optimize search visibility. It can also suggest hashtags and content ideas for better networking.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-teal-600 mt-8 mb-4">8. Mock Interviews and Practice Questions</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      Generative AI can simulate behavioral and technical interview questions based on job titles and industries. It even helps draft model answers to STAR-based (Situation, Task, Action, Result) questions.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-teal-600 mt-8 mb-4">9. Career Coaching & Feedback</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      AI can act as a 24/7 career coach, providing honest feedback on your resume, suggesting career paths, or guiding you toward certifications and upskilling opportunities based on market demand.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-teal-600 mt-8 mb-4">10. Portfolio and Project Summaries</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      Struggling to describe your work? AI can write compelling summaries for your GitHub projects, freelance work, or personal portfolio. This is essential for software engineers, designers, and researchers alike.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-teal-600 mt-8 mb-4">11. Skill Gap Analysis</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      By comparing your resume against job descriptions, AI can highlight skills you lack and suggest online courses or certifications to bridge those gaps — helping you stay competitive.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-teal-600 mt-8 mb-4">12. Salary Research and Negotiation Tips</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      AI can gather salary insights from job boards, provide location-based averages, and help you prepare negotiation scripts to confidently discuss compensation with employers.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-teal-600 mt-8 mb-4">13. Industry Trends Monitoring</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      Staying updated is key. Generative AI tools can summarize industry news, predict hiring trends, and recommend which technical skills are becoming more valuable.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-teal-600 mt-8 mb-4">14. Learning Path Recommendations</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      Tools like Gemini and ChatGPT can suggest personalized learning paths based on your goals (e.g., “Become a Data Engineer”) by compiling courses, certifications, and tutorials from trusted platforms.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-teal-600 mt-8 mb-4">15. Job Alerts and Email Automation</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      Some AI tools can help automate job alerts, generate cold emails to recruiters, and track application statuses — giving you more control over your job search pipeline.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-teal-600 mt-8 mb-4">16. Personal Branding Strategy</h2>
